# Pico Park 3D

Pico Park 3D is a 3D game inspired by the original concept of Pico Park. This solo project aims to transpose the essence of Pico Park into a three-dimensional world, offering a reimagined and immersive gaming experience.

## Key Features

- **3D Transposition:** The game introduces an innovative transition from the Pico Park concept to a 3D environment, exploring new dimensions of gameplay and player interaction.
  
- **Collaborative Puzzles:** Embracing Pico Park's core idea of collaboration, this 3D version offers puzzles and challenges that require close cooperation among players to progress in the game.
  
- **Variety of Levels:** Multiple levels offer unique challenges, leveraging the possibilities of 3D for puzzles based on perspective and environmental manipulation.

## Design and Development

I undertook the complete development of the game, from initial conception to final execution, encompassing code, graphics, and UI.

### Development in C#

The entire project was coded using the C# language. Here are some of the features I implemented:

- **3D Perspective Mechanisms:** Creating mechanisms to leverage depth and perspective in 3D was crucial for the game's puzzles, offering an immersive and innovative gameplay experience.
  
- **Multiplayer Interactions:** I implemented mechanisms for smooth multiplayer interactions, fostering cooperation among players to solve puzzles and progress through levels.
  
- **Graphic Optimization:** In addition to feature development, I ensured graphic optimization to ensure a smooth and visually appealing experience while maintaining gameplay fluidity.

This experience was exciting and stimulating, blending creativity and technical skills to bring forth a captivating three-dimensional version of the Pico Park universe.
